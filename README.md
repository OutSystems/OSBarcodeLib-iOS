# OSBarcodeLib

The `OSBarcodePluginLib-iOS` is a library built using `Swift` that offers you a barcode scanner for your iOS application. Supports many popular encoding types of 1D and 2D barcodes, such as:
- 1D Barcodes
	- Codabar (*available from iOS 15.0 onwards*)
	- Code 39
	- Code 93
	- Code 128
	- Databar (GS1)	(*available from iOS 15.0 onwards*)
	- EAN-8
	- EAN-13
	- ITF
	- ITF-14
	- ISBN-10
	- ISBN-13
	- ISBN-13 Dual Barcode
	- RSSExpanded (*available from iOS 15.0 onwards*)
	- UPC-A
	- UPC-E
- 2D Barcodes
	- Aztec Code
	- Data Matrix
	- Micro PDF 417 (*available from iOS 15.0 onwards*)
	- Micro QR (*available from iOS 15.0 onwards*)
	- PDF 417
	- QR Code

The `OSBARCManagerProtocol` protocol provides the main feature of the library, which is the **Barcode Scanner**, to be detailed in the following sections. 
The `OSBARCManagerFactory` provides a way to create the Scanner Flow Manager - the `OSBARCManager` that implements the `OSBARCManagerProtocol` protocol.

## Motivation

This library is to be used by the [Barcode Plugin](https://github.com/OutSystems/cordova-outsystems-barcode). The repository contains a `scripts/build_framework.sh` script that allows the creation of the `OSBarcodeLib.xcframework`. This framework should then be imported into the Cordova bridge as a framework.

## Usage

1. Create the `OSBarcodeLib.xcframework` using the `scripts/build_framework.sh` script. This is achievable through the following bash script.

```console
sh scripts/build_framework.sh
```

2. Include the `OSBarcodeLib.xcframework` on your project. For example, to accomplish this on a Cordova plugin, the following needs to be inserted into the `plugin.xml`.

```xml
<framework src="{path to framework}/OSBarcodeLib.xcframework" embed="true" custom="true" />
```

## Methods

The library uses the following method to interact with:

### Scan Barcode

```swift
func scanBarcode(with instructionsText: String, _ buttonText: String?, _ cameraModel: OSBARCCameraModel, and orientationModel: OSBARCOrientationModel) async throws -> String
```

Triggers the barcode scanner, returning asynchronously, if successful, the scanned value. In case of error, it can throw one of the following:
- **cameraAccessDenied**: if camera access has not been given.
- **scanningCancelled**: If scanning has been cancelled by the end-user. 

The method is composed of the following input parameters:
- **instructionText**: The text to be displayed on the scanning reader view.
- **buttonText**: The text to be displayed for the scan button, if configured. `Nil` value means that the button will not be shown.
- **cameraModel**: Indicates the camera to use to gather input. It can be `back` or `front`.
- **orientationModel**: Indicates the scanning reader view orientation. It can be locked to `portrait` or `landscape` or adapted to the device's current orientation if the value is `adaptive`.
